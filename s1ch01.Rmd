# Introduction
Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence who first coined the term 'Machine Learning' in 1959, and is known to have developed the Samuel Checkers-playing Program [@Samuel], widely accepted as the first machine learning program, offered the first of two definitions of machine learning. He described it as "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." For those that do math in Greek, Tom Mitchell offered perhaps a more satisfying definition. "A computer program is said to learn from experience $\epsilon$ with respect to some class of tasks $\tau$  and performance measure, $\rho$, if its performance at tasks $\tau$, as measured by $\rho$, improves with experience $\epsilon$." [@Mitchell1997].
